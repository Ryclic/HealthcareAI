<h3> What do we do? </h3>
<p>We provide rough AI diagnosis for emerging third world countries lacking medical personnel capacity.<br>
As of now, we are working towards providing an accurate AI model for detecting heart failure and other heart conditions based off of known data markers.<br> 
Users can submit their avaliable health markers and receive a sample diagnosis with up to ~90% accuracy.</p>
<h3> Our Team </h3>
<p> Proudly built by Ryan, Andrew, Justin, and Ronnie.</p>
